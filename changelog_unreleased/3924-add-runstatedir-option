[build]		fdupont
	Added the 'runstatedir' configuration option so by
	giving '-D runstatedir=run' one can override the 'var/run'
	default. This variable and its usage are described in
	GNU Coding Standards or autoconf doc since version 2.70.
	Note this variable is not in meson built-in options.
	(Gitlab #3624)
