	All files and sockets created by Kea servers have been
	restricted to default paths determined at compile time
	which may be overridden by environment variables. This
	includes lease files, log files, forensic log files, control
	channel sockets, and the output from commands such as
	cache-write, lease4-write, and lease6-write. The output
	of config-write is restricted to the directory from which the
	configuration file was read. Use of unsupported paths will
    result in servers emitting errors and refusing to start
	or rejecting commands.  The specifics including the supported
	paths and environment variable names are in the relevant
	ARM sections.
