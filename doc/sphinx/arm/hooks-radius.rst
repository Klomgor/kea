``libdhcp_radius.so``: RADIUS Server Support
============================================

This hook library allows the Kea DHCP servers to use the RADIUS protocol to
authorize DHCP clients for access to client classes or leases or to keep a
journal of DHCP traffic through the accounting service. For details on RADIUS
in Kea, please see :ref:`radius`.
